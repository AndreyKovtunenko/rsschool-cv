## About Me :
#### To date, I have changed many professions. Always looking for something that lights up.
   IT has always attracted and interested me, as a student I wrote a website for my school on IBM 386 in pure HTML. Since that time, many years have passed and technologies have taken off abruptly. <br> But due to the situation in my country, I am ready to change the field of activity, return to what I wanted and catch up. Finally, it's not about the money. That's why I'm here. I believe that this is just the beginning of my journey.
## SOFT and HARD skills:
|  SOFT  |   HARD  |

| Problem-solving  | CSS(Bootstrap)| 
| Teamwork | JavaScript (Fundamentals, ES6+)  |

## Code example:
 #### Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.
 ###### *moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) // returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]*
 
 ```function moveZeros(arr) {
  let newArr = []
  let arrZero = []
  arr.filter((n)=>{n !== 0 ? newArr.push(n): arrZero.push(n) })
  return newArr.concat(arrZero)
}
 ```
